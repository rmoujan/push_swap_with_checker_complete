# Project Name
1-Mandatory Part:

Push_swap is a sorting algorithm project where the goal is to sort a stack of integers using a set of predefined operations. The project typically involves optimizing the sorting algorithm to use the minimum number of moves. 
The main goals are to learn how to create effective sorting methods and improve problem-solving skills. This project encourages strategic thinking and optimization, helped me become better at making programs run faster and use fewer resources.

2-Bonus Part:
In this section, I implemented a checker to verify whether the list of instructions generated by the push_swap program (coded in the mandatory part) effectively sorts the stack.
